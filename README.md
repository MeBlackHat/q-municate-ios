## 5. Audio and Video Calls

Q-municate using QuickBlox WebRTC SDK as call service. You can find more information on it [here](http://quickblox.com/developers/Sample-webrtc-ios).

**5.1 Calls controller**

Call controller has 6 states:

- Incoming audio call
- Incoming video call
- Outgoing audio call
- Outgoing video call
- Active audio call
- Active video call

Call controller is been managed by QMCallManager, basically call manager allocating it with a specific state, whether it is an incoming or outgoing call, then call controller changing its state to active one if required user accepts it.

**5.2 Audio Call**

You can see down below Incoming, outgoing and active audio call screens.


![Figure 5.1 Audio call screen](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_93E53399630C968604A237F0EAB1B99A1C51B88BD402C4A305A46BBA63CA3D8B_1516983533322_AudioCallScreens.png)


Toolbar buttons

- Incoming call:
  - Decline - declines call and closes received session and controller
  - Accept - accepts call and changes call controller state to Active audio call
- Outgoing and active call:
  - Microphone - disables microphone for current call
  - Speaker - whether sound should be played in speaker or receiver. Default for audio calls is receiver.
  - Decline - hanging up current all and closing controller

**5.3 Video Call**

You can see down below Incoming, outgoing and active video call screens.


![Figure 5.1 Video call screen](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_93E53399630C968604A237F0EAB1B99A1C51B88BD402C4A305A46BBA63CA3D8B_1516977747381_video_call.png)


By default sound for video calls is in speakers.

- Incoming call:
  - Decline - declines call and closes received session and controller
  - Accept - accepts call and changes call controller state to Active video call
- Outgoing and active call:
  - Camera - enables/disables camera for current call
  - Camera rotation - changes camera for current call (front/back)
  - Microphone - disables microphone for current call
  - Decline - hanging up current all and closing controller

**5.4 Call Kit**

CallKit allows to integrate calling services with other call-related apps on the system. CallKit provides the calling interface, and we handle the back-end communication with [our VoIP service](https://quickblox.com/developers/SimpleSample-messages_users-ios#Adding_support_for_VOIP_push_notifications). For incoming and outgoing calls, CallKit displays the same interfaces as the Phone app, giving Q-municate application a more native look and feel.

![Figure 5.1 Call controller screen](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_7BF69620C1058AA11632E980A66E2B94CAE1B1639FF018694E91270C4F3093C2_1517255409865_call_kit.png)



## 6. Extensions

**6.2 Intents App Extension(SiriKit for messaging)**

An *Intents app extension* receives user request to send a message from [SiriKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit) and turns it into app-specific actions.


![Figure 6.2 Sending message via SIRI screen](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_7BF69620C1058AA11632E980A66E2B94CAE1B1639FF018694E91270C4F3093C2_1517494955322_siri-min.png)
